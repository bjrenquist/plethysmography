3D Printed Parts
================

This folder contains files of all the 3D printed parts used by the Renquist Lab for building head-out plethysmography chambers. For each part, two files have been provided: (1) a .blend file that can be edited with Blender, a free and open source 3D creation suite; (2) a .stl file that can be used with most 3D printers.

The DAQ Case subfolder contains files for printing a durable case to enclose a USB-1208FS-Plus data acquisition unit from Measurement Computing. This case protects the electonics from the environment and allows for data collection from four separate channels simultaneously.

Because the Renquist Lab performs a lot of research on diabetes, two sets of head-out plethysmography chambers were designed for lean and obese mice. The files for these chambers are separated accordingly into the Lean Chamber and Obese Chamber subfolders. The balloon cuff is the part that fits around the mouse's neck. The number at the end of the balloon cuff file name is the diameter in millimeters of the hole for the mouse's head. The expansion rings act as spacers between the two cylinders used in the chamber. The plunger extension is an optional part that can be placed between the mouse and the syringe plunger in case a mouse is too short for the chamber.

The Renquist Lab uses a Lulzbot Taz 5 model 3D printer with PLA+ filament from eSUN, a printing temperature of 215C, and a bed temperature of 60C. For the balloon cuffs and expansion rings, a high detail print setting and 100% infill is recommended to prevent air leakage.
